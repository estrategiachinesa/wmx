    "reasoning": "Based on the application requirements, specifically the need to manage Chinese trading strategy pages, I recommend the following Firestore structure. The primary collection will be `chineseStrategies` to store the trading strategies. This structure is designed to be simple, secure, and scalable, prioritizing Authorization Independence and enabling secure list operations (QAPs). Since there are no user-specific roles or access controls specified, this structure assumes that all strategies are managed globally by administrators or through some backend process.\n\n**Authorization Independence and QAPs:**\nThe `chineseStrategies` collection does not require any hierarchical authorization since the documents are globally managed. This means that the security rules will be straightforward and will not depend on `get()` calls to parent documents, achieving Authorization Independence. The homogeneous nature of the data within the `chineseStrategies` collection means all strategies have the same security posture and simplifies list operations.\n\n**Simplicity:**\nThis data structure focuses on simplicity. It only contains one collection given the straightforward requirements of the application."
