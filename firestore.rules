/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset defines access control for the Chinese trading strategies database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to trading strategies, but restricts write access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains a single top-level collection, `chineseStrategies`, where each document represents a trading strategy.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is allowed for all strategies.
 * - Write operations (create, update, delete) are denied to all clients by default.
