/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chinese Trading Strategies.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a basic level of access control for Chinese trading strategies,
 * allowing only authenticated users to create, update, and delete strategies.
 * Read access is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All Chinese strategy documents are stored in the top-level `/chineseStrategies` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for all strategies.
 * - Authenticated users can create, update, and delete strategies.
 * - No user-specific ownership or roles are enforced.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * There is no need for denormalization because the authorization is based solely on
 * the user's authentication state, not on any data within the documents themselves.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * There is no segregation, as all strategies are stored in a single collection.
